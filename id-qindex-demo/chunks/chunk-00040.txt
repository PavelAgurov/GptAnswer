We know accidents can happen, but any intentional damage to iQ property will result in costs being passed onto residents. The cost to remedy any damage to communal areas will result in equal charges if no one accepts responsibility. Itâ€™s best to be proactive to avoid any surprise charges for damages. Report any repairs or damage as soon as possible so we can fix it and discuss whether there will be any charges. You can log any repairs via the maintenance section of your resident portal, or on the app.
