Booking online is quick and easy – it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. If you prefer, you can call us (it’s best to call the site you want to book at direct), or visit us at your chosen iQ location. You will need to pay a non-refundable booking fee to secure your booking, which can be paid by debit or credit card.
