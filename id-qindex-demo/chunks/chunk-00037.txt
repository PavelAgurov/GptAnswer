The safety and security of our residents is our number one priority. All of our sites are fully compliant with current safety standards. Our accommodation has fire alarm systems in place as well as fire prevention equipment, and we carry out regular testing and evacuation drills. Our buildings are also regularly audited by external, independent consultants. iQ has a full-time, highly qualified, Health and Safety team who visit sites regularly. We also use accredited national providers to service and maintain life safety systems. Additionally, all sites have staff present 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We are continually reviewing our programme of security, fire and safety standards. If you would like further information about our ongoing fire safety programme please read our fire safety update.
