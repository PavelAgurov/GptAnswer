Complaints can be made directly through the iQ App or by sending an email to the site team or Hello@iqstudentaccommodation.com where the appropriate member of iQ will seek to find a resolution. We try to resolve any complaints internally, but understand there may be times when this is not possible. Our complaints procedure is detailed here.
