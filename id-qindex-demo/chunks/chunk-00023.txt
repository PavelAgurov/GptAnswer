If you need to leave iQ, you’ll need to find another student to take over your tenancy for the remainder of your contract. A tenancy takeover is only possible for contracts that are over 16 weeks, past the first month, and before the last two months of the contract end date. Before you can start setting up a replacement, you’ve got to pay any remaining rent you owe. A cancellation fee will be charged, equal to your booking fee or one weeks’ rent. Other charges may be added. Once you find a replacement, we’ll need some details before we can set up a contract. Until the new tenant completes their booking, makes payment and collects their keys, you’ll still be liable. Read more about tenancy takeovers.
