Yes, the vast majority of our sites have a laundry room where you can wash and dry your clothes. These are operated by an independent provider, Circuit Laundry or Miele. You will need to pay to use the machines via a top-up card or their mobile app. For our London residents, Pinglocker provides convenient collection & delivery service for dry cleaning and laundry at an additional cost. You can book these services through iQ Student Sevices on the iQ app – or you can visit PingLocker’s website
