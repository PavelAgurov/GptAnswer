We offer free dual occupancy across a limited number of our studios where both residents are students. You'll see the dual occupancy symbol next to the room number if it is available when you select the room via the floorplan. We'll ask for your partner's details during the booking stages. Both you and your partner must sign our tenancy agreement and have student status for the duration of the booking.
