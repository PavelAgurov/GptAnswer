No, that’s down to you and your flatmates. We’ll keep the common areas of the building, like the social spaces, reception and laundry, clean and tidy. Many residents put a rota together so each person in the flat does their bit to keep it clean. If you would prefer to get someone in to do it, you can book cleaning services through the app (provided by Pinglocker at certain locations) at an additional cost.
